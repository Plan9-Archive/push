This is the old unix port of push. 

It should work on any unices supported by plan 9 port(a unix Plan 9 compatibility layer, it's available at http://swtch.com/plan9port/ please install it first)

cd /usr/local
wget http://swtch.com/plan9port/plan9port.tgz
tar zxvf plan9port.tgz
PLAN9=/usr/local/plan9 export PLAN9
PATH=${PATH}:$PLAN9/bin 
cd $OLDPWD # go back to this README's directory
mk # make
mk install
# need to put the filters up
push -c 'echo test |<[1] cat >| cat'

I've also included some interesting tools. 
mkc osxself
